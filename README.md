# Music Information Retrieval and Genre Classification

This repository contains the capstone project for Udacity's Machine Learning
Nanodegree. It offers an introduction to Music Information Retrieval, and
looks at musical genre classification.

The report is accompanied by python (v.2.7) code intended for the reader to
apply the same techniques treated in the report to their own musical libraries
and genres.
